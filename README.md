# [WIP] Keyboard Extensions

Personal project with the goal of adding keys to a keyboard with an Arduino Nano and some electronics, allowing them to send keyboard inputs (ie. macros)

The associated desktop application also allows some keys to be used as special keys to mute or deafen yourself on Discord, with leds inside the key caps to display the current mute and deaf status.

**Warning :** this project is not finished yet and might not work if you clone the current state of this repository. To try the project, simply upload the Arduino sketch to an Arduino Nano and open the C# solution inside Visual Studio.
